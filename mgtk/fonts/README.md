# MouseGraphics Fonts

This is a collection of fonts that work with MGTK.

The `bin/convert_font.pl` tool can be used to convert a 768-byte HiRes
Character Generator (HRCG) font to MTGK format. Several are included
below, from the Applesoft Toolkit 1.0 by Apple, 1980.

The `bin/dump_font.pl` tool can be used to preview a font, displaying
an ASCII rendition of the pixels on the console.

The `bin/make_font.pl` tool can be used to reverse the process, and
take a textual representation of a font and convert it back to a
binary representation.

If these are transferred to an Apple disk and changed to file type $07
(FNT) then the `SHOW.FONT.FILE` preview accessory can show them in
DeskTop.

Single width fonts can be 1-7 pixels wide. Double width fonts can be
1-14 pixels wide. Glyphs must include inter-character spacing
(kerning); MGTK does not add this. This allows special glyphs to be
used to produce small graphics, similar to MouseText's folder glyphs.
